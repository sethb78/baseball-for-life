Going forward there might be some bumpy waters for the crew with the losses of KungFu Panda and Mariano. We will soon see how much water this boat can take before it capsizes, and I now end my horrible fishing puns. The onen positive is the return of ace Cliff Lee. As of now though this is my top dog.','JJ Hardy (5R/3HRs/4RBIs, .990 OPS)','Josh Willingham (A whole bunch of zeroes along with a .246 OPS. No question that Josh is Willing, but is he Able)?'),
('4','April 30-May6','4','Eric Waldstein','20-18-2','7','+3','Although it hasn\'t been flashy the team has slowly begun to hit, currently led by NL Player of the Week \"Fab-5\" Freddie Freeman. One is lead to believe that #1 Pick Miguel Cabrera is due to break out at any moment here, which could really boost this offense. Adam Jones is another possible break-out Oriole as he continues to put up solid numbers across the stat sheet. The pitching is questionable in my eyes, and they lucked out in getting a 1-0 win in saves. Still I am not here to rain on their parade, especially after a big win this past week','Freddie Freeman (6R/3HR/10RBIs/1.130OPS)','Miguel Cabrera (1R/2RBIs/.699OPS -- Not gonna cut it)'),
('4','April 30-May6','2','Chris Mantione','23-13-4','3','+1','There is a muddled pile after the top spot, and you can really go a couple ways here and have supportive arguments. Although Joey suffered his first defeat of the season he still rests atop the overall standings which was enough to keep him in the #2 spot, along with the fact that no one else did enough (yet) to prove their own case. To quote the great R&B divas SWV Rickie is Week in the Knees, as he continues to play horrible, but is continueing to be run out there. We will see how much longer this can last. Matt Weiters continues to breakthrough this year, posting another nice week to help lead the offense. Pirate streamer James McDonald brought two stellar starts to give the team their only two wins of the week. We will see if he can keep that up.','James McDonald (14IP/2W/17Ks/2.57 ERA/1.21 WHIP)','Nelly Cruz (He\'s going down, down baby. Hard to have such putrid stats on such a huge run-producing team, but Nelson succeded 2R/2RBI/.269OPS)'),
('4','April 30-May6','3','Kevin O''Brien','18-19-3','5','+2','Again the Jews can\'t catch a break in the injury department as they continue to wait on their parade of injured All-Stars to return (possibly starting with Lance Berkman within the next week). With all that said they still are keeping themselves in the top half of the standings. They mostly have their pitching to thank for this. In 60 innings their rotation sported an ERA of 2.10 and a sup 1.00 WHIP, along with 6 Wins and 67Ks, and this included Matt Thornton\'s \"1-inning\" sabotage attempt giving up 4 runs by himself. Ok so if you take those runs out that would be 10ER and 46Hits/Walks in 59 innings which are sick ERA and WHiP ratios. This is one team where the pitching might just be able to carry the load by themselves.','Felix Hernandez (Sick 16IP/W/18Ks/0.56 ERA/0.75 WHIP)','Aaron Hill (2RBIs/SB/.427OPS)'),
('4','April 30-May6','5','Rob Gleason','16-20-4','4','-1','This team\'s overall stats seem competitive, yet they have not won since the first week of the season, so something is off here. Possibly it is the owner. The low-mark of the week was Adrian Gonzalez being K\'d by Escargot\'s 3B, Chris Davis, to end an 0-8 Sunday afternoon. But while we await the arrival of Gonzalez, Cano and McCutchen, the potpouri pitching staff decided to step things up winning all the categories except saves. Now it would be amazing to see both sides of the team do this at the same time, but until then it is hard to put them much higher then this (especially since they are in 10th place in the real standings)','Yu Darvish (13IP/W/20Ks/2.77ERA/1.23WHIP)','Joe Mauer (An RBI/.217OPS)'),
('4','April 30-May6','7','Dave Majofsky','20-18-2','9','+2','Well it looks like baseball started a month late this year for Giancarlo Stanton. After doing little in April, Stanton shot out like a cannon blasting 4 of the team\'s 9 longballs this past week. Combine that with Jeff Weaver\'s little brother\'s No-No and you have a nice week on both sides. Now that Stanton is hitting this team might really start to make some moves in the standings, since their pitching has been their strength so far this year.','Jered Weaver (No Hitter, beats out Giancarlo. 9IP/W/9Ks/0.00ERA/0.11WHIP)','Josh Johnson (2.2IP/1K/20.25ERA/3.38WHIP)'),
('4','April 30-May6','8','Dave Waldstein','22-16-2','3','-5','When your team ERA (6.75) is higher then your team OPS (.614) you know you have had a bad week. Now they will get a chance to live up to their team name (if I have the definition for redemption correct). Someone needs to step up and have a big week on offense (Konerko, Prince, Ben Zobrist). I would mention Kevin Youkilis here too, but I just read that he is starting a walking program, so it sounds like he has a little ways to go. I am willing to give the pitching a pass because Halladay\'s track record allows it and Strasburg and even Minor have really pitched pretty good besides this past week (really Strasbur wasn\'t that bad just low K number but the WHIP was still stupendous). It looks like Adam Wainwright is getting his feel back too which is a good sign. But unlike the Jews, I don\'t think this team\'s rotation is that good to carry them every week. They need the bats to wake up.','Adam Wainwright (14IP/2W/13Ks/3.21 ERA/1.00 WHIP)','Roy Halladay (5.1IP/5Ks/13.50 ERA/2.25 WHIP)'),
('4','April 30-May6','6','Arjun Rajeev','18-21-1','6','---','Playing to their name the Joe\'s find themselves right on the cusp of the Hot List playoffs. The offense continues to improve each week as the bats of Jason Heyward and Dan Uggla start to heat up, while the Davids (Wright and Freese) continue to put up respectable numbers. The pitching had some setbacks as 1st Round pick Tim Lincecum, and rookie phenom Matt Moore have been shaky at best, but CJ Wilson definitely did his part to carry the staff grabbing two victories and 13Ks. Heath Bell has finally been put out of his misery which will only help this team\'s ERA and WHIP.','CJ Wilson (15.1IP/2W/13Ks/2.93 ERA/0.98WHIP)','Heath Bell (The Bell was Rung - 3IP/1K/1Sv/15.00ERA/3.00WHIP)'),
('4','April 30-May6','9','Mark Colantoni','18-20-2','11','+2','It looks like Ryan Braun has found his swing clubbing 4 homeruns, and Pujols finally hit his first homerun of the season helping the Colonel sweep all the offensive categories in his match-up. If Jeter and Beltran can find a way to keep their torrid hitting going then there is potential for the Colonel to challenge for the best offense in the league. The pitching was a bit down this week but the names (Kershaw, Gallardo, Santana) at the head of the rotation make me think for now that they can compete in these categories most weeks.','Ryan Braun (4R/4HRs/7RBIs/SB/1.431OPS)','Brandon Phillips (1R/2RBIs/.236OPS)'),
('4','April 30-May6','11','Matt Stockwell','16-20-4','11','---','Pulling out a win in the final innings of the week helped to rescue the team from the bottom spot. Still that being said there are a bunch of issues going on with this team. One of the positives though was Hunter Pence. His two homeruns on Sunday night helped the Epidemic tie Runs and win HR\'s by one. The pitching was overall solid except for the AJ Burn Unit. No amount of fire trucks could have contained this fire as Burnett accounted for half his staff\'s 24 earned runs while I only pitchin in 2.2 innings. That is quite an accomplishment. If it wasn\'t for him the staff might have had a chance in a couple of the pitching categories.','Hunter Pence (7R/3HRs/9RBIs/SB/1.077OPS)','AJ Burnett (2.2IP/2Ks/40.50 ERA/4.88 WHIP)'),
('4','April 30-May6','12','Jeff Stern','15-23-2','8','-4','If your team goes the whole week and can only muster a single homerun in an OPS league then your offense is in trouble. Add to that the injury to their first round pick 3rd Baseman Evan Longoria, who leads your team in the OPS category, and now you can enter panic mode. The KC-duo or Carlos Pena will have to pick up the slack or this team will be in a lot of trouble. The starting of a hurt Josh Beckett likely prevented them from breaking the tie in Ks, still with Verlander and Shields leading the way this pitching staff is still pretty strong. It just needs to cut some of the excess baggage.','Mike Bourn (7R/3RBIs/2SB/.704OPS','Jhoulys Chacin (4.2IP/3Ks/13.50 ERA/3.21 WHIP)'),
('4','April 30-May6','10','Jay Kondas','17-22-1','8','-2','Carlos Gonzalez will look to possibly repeat as Stud of the Week this week, but he might have a hard enough time his own team\'s weekly honor. The hot hitting has become contagious as LaHair is still on fire and Indian Rookie 2B Jason Kipnis has started to swing the lumber too. All three posted OPS over 1.000 helping Escargot to sweep the offensive categories. And this was a sweep of the #1 Team on this list (who has a pretty nice offense themselves), so they earned this. Now the pitching will need to step up to the challenge. Garza unexpectedly missed his start and then Luebke was DL\'d after the week had begun. This really hurt them in their chances for W (which they lost by 1) and Ks(which they lost by 7). They will need to find some other pitchers to step up, but with a trio of Kennedy, Garza and the \"out of nowhere\" Lance Lynn they at least have a trio to build off of.','Carlos Gonzalez (6R/3HRs/9RBIs/SB/1.326OPS)','Cory Luebke (for not telling his owner he was hurt before the Monday lineup lock)'),
('5','May 7-13','1','Seth B. Altshuler','30-18-2','1','---','This team keeps trucking along, and moves into the top spot in the actual standings too. The return of Cliff Lee was a nice boost, and although the closers might have bombed the ERA and WHIP, they still got their saves, and the starters did enough to win the ERA and WHIP categories anyways. And all this while getting pretty much nothing so far from Keeper/Future Star Eric Hosmer. No signs of this team being dethroned as of yet.','Josh Willingham (4R/2HRs/5RBIs/1.248OPS)','Eric Hosmer (2Rs/2RBIs/.340 OPS - prolonged slump continues)'),
('5','May 7-13','5','Eric Waldstein','23-25-2','4','-1','Elvis Andrus should probably send Josh Hamilton a thank you card as he scored 10 Runs last week mostly due to Smackhead\'s bat. It was a down week on the scoreboard but the pitching has shown some signs of improvement. Anibal Sanchez and Gavin Floyd combined for 14.2 innings of shutout ball. The annointing of Kenley Jansen as the Dodgers closer rewarded the team\'s patience in him. It is possible by the end of the season that with Kimbrel this could be the strongest closer duo in the league. Still awaiting signs of life from Miguel Cabrera and Justin Upton. The track records still point towards a positive future there.','Elvis Andrus (10R/0HR/4RBIs/1SB/1.002 OPS','Ubaldo Jimenez (4.1IP/4Ks/14.54 ERA/3.23 WHIP)'),
('5','May 7-13','3','Chris Mantione','27-18-5','2','-1','If Josh Hamilton can stay healthy and keep his priorities in check then this team is going to be a force to be reckoned with come playoff time. His 9 homeruns beat every other team\'s homerun totals for the week. That is just crazy. I think the other thing though that sneaks under the radar is that if you took him out of the equation this team still hit 9 more homeruns and that is while still starting Rickie Weeks who has a hard enough time hitting a ball off a tee these days. So the power and run production is there. So some would then assume that the area that still needs help is the pitching, but actually they didn\'t do too bad last week. They just ran into the best pitching staff in the business and faced the consequences. If they continue to pitch like they did and combine that with their hiitting they should win most weeks, and stay in the conversation for a bye as the season progresses.','Josh Hamilton (10R/9HRs/18RBIs/1.963 OPS)','Rickie Weeks (This guy must have pictures of the owner or something on him. That\'s the only way I can understand him still making the starting lineup 1R/.250OPS)'),
('5','May 7-13','2','Kevin O''Brien','23-23-4','3','+1','They beat \"The SMACK\", so by rule (that I made up) they have to jump them in the rankings. The Jews worked their magic and clawed out one offensive category and then worked their magic again on the pitching side. The Drunk Jews rank in the top two overall in every pitching category but Saves, and that is the only one they didn\'t win (instead they tied it). This week they welcome back Lance Berkman. He is the first in a long line of bats awaiting clearance from the DL Administrators, and his arrival cannot come soon enough as they currently rank near the bottom in homeruns.','Carlos Zambrano (16IP/16Ks/W/0.56 ERA/0.75 WHIP)','David Price (7IP/4Ks/6.43 ERA /2.00 WHIP)'),
('5','May 7-13','4','Rob Gleason','16-20-4','5','+1','Last week both the pitching and hitting came together with the team only losing one category. Some of the slumbering bats are coming alive (see Mr. McCutchen and Robbie Cano (don\'t you know)). Oh and the Rafael Furcal Experience finally needs some pub as the chances of this lasting much longer can\'t really be expected It will be key that these bats continue to produce as their team leader and #2 overall pick Matt Kemp has been placed on the DL, with a minor hamstring strain. The pitching is an improving work in progress with no definite ace as of yet, but doing enough.','Andrew McCutchen (5R/3HRs/6RBIs/SB/1.600 OPS)','Robin Ventura (for screwing with Chris Sale\'s head)'),

This offense is quickly becoming well-rounded with Stanton and Votto beginning to hit for power and Zimmerman regaining his health. Plus the arival of Bryce Harper (in the shadows of the Mike Trout hysteria) only strengthens this offense even more. The way that Jered Weaver (minus the Rangers start) and Beachy Keen are performing will keep them in the conversation for pitching each week.','Joey Votto (7R/3HRs/8RBIs/1SB/1.586 OPS)','Ricky Nolasco (4.2IP/3Ks/11.57 ERA/2.57 WHIP)'),
('5','May 7-13','9','Dave Waldstein','24-23-3','8','-1','Ok the shine from the successful first week has just about worn off. Someone needs to step up and stop the ball from rolling down the hill. Horrible weeks from Bartolo, Wainwright and Hunber on the mound and Fielder Lowrie and Stubbs at the plate. The one positive note to take is that Halladay looks like he has regained his form after his one bad start, and Strasburg continues to look like the real deal with his 13K performance. But overall this is a week that Team Redemption might want to flush down the toilet and not look at ever again.','Stepehn Strasburg (6IP/13Ks/W/1.50 ERA/ 1.33 WHIP)','Bart Colon (2.1 IP/0K/27.00 ERA/3.86 WHIP) - wins the award for team worst pitcher in a close battle with Wainwright.'),

They were just victims of the schedule maker, facing a team that just had a very good week. Against most opponents they would have been able to win at least one offensive category but instead got shut out. Now it is important that Wright, Holiday and friends prove that what I am saying is true. Fernando Rodney fits into that same Jim Johnson crazy closer year category as he racked up a save and a win in 3 scoreless innings of relief.','Adan LaRoche (4R/2HRs/7RBIs/1/477 OPS)','Buster Posey (1R/1RBI/.282 OPS) - Hope the knee is doing ok.'),
('5','May 7-13','10','Mark Colantoni','23-25-2','9','-1','When you tie a team that started 3DL\'d players it really isn\'t a good sign. The offense really can\'t be blamed as they won every category except steals. The pitching stunk up the joint led by two horrible clunkers from Joe Saunders. Still with a rotation led by Kershaw and Santana I believe that better days should be ahead for their stats if the supporting class doesn\'t do anything stupid. The Josh Hamilton Experience caused everyone to miss out on the spectacular week that Carlos Beltran had as he continues to play out of his mind to start the season.','Carlos Beltran (8R/6HRs/13RBIs/1.648 OPS)','Joe Saunders (8.1 IP/3K/12.96 ERA/2.52 WHIP)'),
('5','May 7-13','8','Matt Stockwell','23-23-4','11','+3','Probably the best week of this team\'s early season. The offense led by Pedroia and Markakis, and the pitching was strong as Greinke, Cain, McCarthy and Vogelsong gave up a total of 2ERs in 28.1IP. Now it will remain to be seen if the team can build off this strong week, or if this was just a lucky week. For all the craziness that has happened this year with closers it is interesting to see that Jim Johnson has been one of the more consistent guys out there this year (see if that jinx works).','Zack Greinke (8IP/11Ks/0.00 ERA/ 0.25 WHIP, but no Win)','Dan Haren (3.2IP / 0Ks/12.27 ERA/ 2.73 WHIP)'),

I honestly think that it is time to call out first round pick Troy Tulowitzki. His start has been so-so (not as bad as Texiera\'s) at best and at some point this guy needs to have a big week to give this team a lift. The pitching was better then the hitting was, so try to just take that as a positive without looking too closely at the stats. The one bright spot has to be Lancy Lynn, as the Cardnal starter continues to roll with two more strong starts this past week.','Lance Lynn (11IP/14Ks/W/2.45 ERA/1.27 WHIP)','Troy Tulowitzki (One Measely Run/.417 OPS)');
