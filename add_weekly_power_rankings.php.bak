VALUES('8','May 4-10','1','Seth B. Altshuler','56-30-4','2','+1','All he did was take a team that had won the last two weeks in a row and had risen up the standings and pound them into submission with an 8-2 victory. His offense toned it down but still swept the board with rookie phenom Mike Trout leading the way with one heck of a week. Most weeks 5 saves would win you the category but this wasn\'t one of them, still the Fisherman won 3 of the 5 categories. Eventhough the closers failed in the saves they provided nice stats to help win ERA allowing only 1ER over 7IP, striking out 5. And Cliff Lee still searches for win #1.','Mike Trout (10R/0HR/4RBIs/4SBs/1.167 OPS)','Mark Reynolds (3R/0HRs/RBI/.514 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','2','Chris Mantione','47-35-8','3','-1','Although the Smackers won, I was unable to keep them in the top spot. Mainly because their owner really just lacks the championship pedigree that the one team above him has. But with the season he is having it is def something that is within his grasp if he wants it. His offense made quick work of his opponent this week winning everything except steals which he tied. As Josh Hamilton calms down new people such as stud keeper Jose Bautista, and Waiver Wire Golden Boy Mark Trumbo, who both went off, combining for 9R/7HRs/19RBIs. These two people alone would have won HRs and tied RBIs by themselves this week. That is sick. The pitching is still a work in progress. Demptser continues to shine, and might be starting to take over the reigns as ace. Jon Lester and Rick Romer are hard to figure out this year. They have the names and Romero has the wins, but the ratios aren\'t that impressive as of yet. Jamie Garcia is horrible. The fact that he was started continues to highlight some of the ineptitudes of this ownership regime.','Mark Trumbo (5R/4HRs/12RBIs/1.204 OPS)','Jamie Garcia (2IP/2Ks/0Wins/27.00 ERA/3.50 WHIP)'),
('8','May 4-10','3','Mark Colantoni','48-37-5','7','+4','Well I kept saying early on that on offense this team had potential. I still don\'t know if it has fully come out of the closet but it was enough this week. Adam Dunn\'s 3HRs gave the Moose a vicory by one in that category, as Pujols and him combined for almost half the teams match-winning 31RBIs for the week. Although Johan came back to Earth after the no-no and Stud of the Week honors, the rest of the staff did enough to win 4 of the pitching categories against a horrible opposing staff for the week.','Adam Dunn (4R/3HRs/8RBIs/.960OPS)','Derek Jeter (2R/0HR/0RBIs/0SB/.361 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','4','Kevin O\'Brien','42-42-6','3','-1','Possibly could have been higher last week, and possibly could have been lower this week. The Jewish offense continued to represent their stinginess, with a pedestrian .6408 Team OPS. Although a little lower then normal a weak offense has been a trademark so far this year for this organization. Where things went haywire was on the mound. Carlos Zambrano reverted back to his old self blowing the team pitching stats to smithereens giving up 7ER in 2.1IP. Strong starts from Gio and Price were able to save the WHIP category, but not the ERA. They also lost a tough close battle in the K department 39/38. One can only imagine that if Z could have gone more then 2.1 innings more Ks might have come.','Gio Gonzalez (6.1IP/5Ks/Win/2.84 ERA/0.79 WHIP)','Adrian Beltre (R/2RBIs/.459 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','5','Eric Waldstein','43-42-5','5','---','The stats weren\'t spectacular but it is enough as the tie keeps Chagrin locked in at the 5-slot. Miguel Cabrera was the only one with multiple homeruns with his 2nd blast being the deciding factor to get them the win in that category. Spark-plug and Waiver-Wire Find Jose Altuve has been quite the assett with his team leading 6Runs getting Chagrin the victory in this category. The bullpen continues to shine as Kimbrel/Jensen locked up 5 more saves and 9Ks in 6IP. The rest of the rotation was hit or miss, with Chad Billingsly and Tommy Hanson having strong performances.','Jose Altuve (6R/HR/4RBIs/SB/1.095 OPS)','Anibal Sanchez (12.2IP/7Ks/0Wins/7.82 ERA/1.50 WHIP)'),
('8','May 4-10','6','Arjun Rajeev','36-50-4','11','+5','The league rankings yo-yo jumps back up five nothches to the #6 slot in the rankings. I understand they are 11th in the standings, but continue to believe that this will even itself out Wait what? Did they just trade half their team to Ralphie for half his team? Ok I am going to take his slot to try to just decipher this trade. I do think that Arjun got the best player in this deal in Stanton. He has a bunch of years of eligibility and his best years are still ahead of him. In order to get this keeper stud though he took a minor hit at 3rd Base, and a somewhat significant hit in SP. I am not sure Oswalt will be that big a factor pitching in the heat of Texas (eventhough he grew up there), and Bailey is no more then a #5 SP. I think the key here is somewhat that wasn\'t even involved in the trade. That would be Tim Lincecum. If Lincecum can ever figure things out then the Joe\'s could maybe survive with him Zimmerman and him leading the way. Then maybe Scherzer or Moore figures things out or Hudson stays healthy, but Lincecum is the key for this year. For the future though he has a great keeper to build with.','Dan Uggla (8R/3HRs/9RBIs/1.342 OPS)','Max Scherzer (4.1IP/2Ks/0Wins/10.38 ERA/2.31 WHIP)'),
('8','May 4-10','7','Matt Stockwell','44-41-5','6','-1','One of the four teams that salvaged a tie this past week. This was a week where the offense took a rest, knocking 6HRs, but only 18Runs (the lowest of any team this past week). They were unable to swipe a bag and overall were unable to swipe any offensive categories. They in turn swept the pitching, thanks in part to great performances from McCarthy, Cain and Ryan Vogelsong. The newly acquired Mark Teixeira did make a mark in his first week leading the team in HRs with 2, and tying for the team lead in OPS with .975. That will hopefully be a sign of things to come to one of the worst team offenses in this league.','Ryan Vogelsong (14.2 IP/6Ks/2Wins/1.84 ERA/0.95 WHIP)','Hanley Ramirez (ZZZZZeroes/.347 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','8','Dave Waldstein','44-40-6','7','-1','Outside of Paul Konerko and Prince Fielder, there just isn\'t much going on with this offense to get excited about. I understand that Choo, Rollins and Youk, can all go off at any moment, but as of yet none of them have really strung together much. This factored into them losing every offensive category except steals where they tied. The pitching was able to salvage things, and outside of some poor spot-starts from Scott Feldman and Phil Humber they likely would have swept the pitching. It is safe to say that the Strasburg trade from last year is paying plenty of dividends this year. That guy is filthy.','Stephen Strasburg (6IP/13Ks/Win/3.00 ERA/1.00 WHIP)','Kevin Youkilis (1R/0HRs/1RBI/.483 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','9','Jay Kondas','39-49-2','9','---','Newly acquired Zack Greinke went right to work putting to rest any worries of who got the better end of this deal. All of a sudden this team\'s pitching has evolved into a possible strength, posting the week\'s best ERA, WHIP and Ks. Greinke\'s 13K, 7IP-shutout win a major key. The only thing that prevented this from being a huge week was the offense, or lack there of. The team will need to continue to scratch and claw as they await the return of their Top Draft Pick Tulowitzki.','Zack Greinke (7IP/12Ks/Win/0.00 ERA/0.57 WHIP)','Justin Smoak (2R/0HRs/0RBIs/.397 OPS)'),
('8','May 4-10','10','Dave Majofsky','40-46-4','8','-2','In regards to the other member of this insane mega-deal, losing Giancarlo dont call me Mike Stanton is a big hit to the team this year, and for the future. That being said CJ Wilson might be the important key for the Suckas. With Jered Weaver soon coming off the DL, and the great year Brandon Beachy is having the rotation has the parts to become one of the top ones in the league. The other parts, I think are a bit of a wash. I would give a slight edge with Wright over A-Rod and a little more of an edge with Stanton over Holiday. But the new offensive players should not hurt the team, as they head into the 2nd half.','Joey Votto (4R/HR/5RBIs/SB/1.190 OPS)','Homer Bailey (9.2IP/9K/0Wins/8.38 ERA/1.86 WHIP)'),
('8','May 4-10','11','Rob Gleason','35-46-9','10','-1','The offense maybe deserved better belting double-digit homeruns in a losing cause, and losing RBIs by two, but the pitching was down-right horrible. The closers provided a vulture win but no saves, and outside of budding ace Chris Sale, the rest of the rotation was brutal. Things need to be figured out in that department, or there will be more of this pain heading into the summer. They were lucky to somehow grab 5 wins (the one pitching category they won) while having a 5.60 team ERA.','Robinson Cano (4R/3HRs/5RBIs/1.298 OPS)','Yu Darvish (5.1IP/4Ks/10.13 ERA/2.25 WHIP)'),
('8','May 4-10','12','Jeff Stern','35-51-4','12','---','Michael Bourn has recently taken over as the power bat for this team. That is not a good sign, and the teams 1 homerun, and 12 RBIs highlighted another down week from the bats. They were able to swipe 7 bases to give them one win on offense, but Evan Longoria cannot come back soon enough for this lineup. Outside of a rusty Daniel Hudson the rotation did a good enough job to salvage the ERA and WHIP, but lose the other 3. There continues to be nowhere to go but up for these guys.','Michael Bourn (5Rs/1HR/4RBIs/SB/1.305 OPS)','Daniel Hudson (1.2IP/K/0Wins/32.40 ERA/4.80 WHIP)');
